# Uni-Student-Loan-Debt-Calculator

## Description
A very simple personal project for me to calculate the debt of going to Uni and the amount you will pay back.

In the UK, you pay back money regardless of how much you took out based on you personal income. This code cycles through different income levels to calculate how much you will be paying.

It then compares the value against how much you took out, and tells you if you paid back more than you were given.

In other words, it calculates the average salary across your whole career that you need for you to be paid back more than you put in.

## Usage
Run the main.py file. You can clone it, and you'll probably want to make changes, improve it, change variables, etc. If you make a change that improves it, feel free to do a pull request!
